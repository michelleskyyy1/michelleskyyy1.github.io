        <h1 class="About-me">Turks and Caicos: An Unforgettable Experience</h1>
        <h4>April 8 2022
        08:29</h4>
          <p>Growing up, I hated the heat. </p>
          <p>If anything, summer was the season where I spent most of my time at home. Why would I want to leave the comfort of the indoors, with nice AC and without the blazing sun hitting me incessantly? No, I much preferred pulling out my drawing tablet and sitting by my kitchen window, the sun barely in reach.</p> 
          <p>But I admit; that’s somewhat changed ever since my trips to Beaches Turks and Caicos. </p>
           <div class="container">
                <div class="row">
    <div class="col-12">

    </div>
</div>
        </div>
<p>I do enjoy tropical places, don’t get me wrong. But there was always that dreadful heat that creeped in, unavoidable and, well, expected. But Beaches was different; there was a constant sea breeze that seemed to follow me everywhere. From the bar to the hotel pool, that breeze always mellowed out the sun’s glare, even when it was at its highest point in the sky, brushing aside the full extent of the sun’s heat. When it rained (and it rained quite often when I last visited), it was cooling, refreshing. The humidity the next day wasn’t stifling. </p>
<p>But Beaches was more than its perfectly sublime weather conditions. The scenery, as well, was nothing like I’ve ever seen before. Picture this: white, soft sand, an expanse of sea in the most dazzling shades of lapis lazuli and teal, white hammocks strewn between palm trees, and bright white tents hanging over elegant lounge chairs. And the occasional gazebo, looking out over the ocean.  </p>

          <p>Beaches is divided into five villages: Italian Village, French Village, Caribbean Village, Key West Village, and Seaside Suites. I’ve had the great fortune of residing in both the Italian and French Village. Despite them being located so close to each other, both have the most unique atmospheres. Take the French Village, where buildings are painted in cozy shades of pink, orange, blue, and yellow. The building architecture is somewhat reminiscent of French architecture, as most buildings include round towers, French windows and shutters, and balanced, symmetrical proportions. In the centre of the village is a massive pool, where one end includes a pool bar and the other a large white bridge leading up to a view of the entire village. Past the residence suites is a small lineup of restaurants, like Giuseppe’s, Le Petit Chateau, and the Café de Paris. The Café de Paris was my favourite, and most aesthetic shop to visit. Checkered floors, a beautiful wooden counter, and a massive selection of French pastries, from pain au chocolat to the iconic croissant. My sister and I would often frequent this place, just to breathe in the fresh smell of freshly baked bread and sugary snacks. </p>

    </div>
</div>
        </div>
          
          <p>I remember the village being a quiet, calming sort of place. There was no calmer time, in fact, than when I lounged in a hammock by the French Village pool, reading a fictional book (probably some sappy romance). All I could hear was the quiet rustle of palm leaves and the occasional kid yelling giddily a ways away. </p>
          <p>The Italian village, however, was abuzz with activity. This village was much bigger than the French one, with the suite buildings going up to six stories and wrapping all around the entirety of the Italian village pool, which was at least twice the size of the French one. Whether there was a concert happening by the pool, or a party, the Italian Village was where the action was at. Staying there, I recall hearing the constant booming of a microphone as music played or events were hosted. People—many of them teenagers or young adults—dressed in their nicest summer outfits in the evenings, most likely heading to dinner at places like the Schooners Seafood Grill, Marios, the Courtyard Bistro, or enjoying the party life at the Bombay Club. Such was the kind of events one must do when residing in the Italian Village. </p>

          <p>As I sit here now, in my room pondering over these events, I can’t help but be struck by the absolute surrealness of my experiences there. No other resort, in fact, quite compared to Beaches Turks and Caicos, and I doubt that will ever change. </p>
