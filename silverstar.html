        <h1 class="About-me">A Wintery Escape to the Silver Star Mountain</h1>
        <h4>April 8 2022

        <p>I confess; I’m not much of a nature person. For one, I’m not a fan of bugs. Of any kind. And nature seems to bring with it a lot of bugs. </p>
        <p>Which is why winter is the far more superior time of the year to explore nature. At that time, the cold scares away the insects, and covers everything in this blanket of sheer white snow. It’s stunning, when you stop to think about it. And ideal for skiing. </p>

        <p>My skiing journey started early on in my life—I can still just vaguely remember my six-year-old self, trying on skis for the firs time, falling, crashing into trees, desperately clinging onto a sense of balance and direction. And it all started at the <a href="https://www.skisilverstar.com/" target="_blank">Silver Star Mountain Resort</a>, in Kelowna, BC. </p>
        <p>The mountain itself is huge—just looking at a map, you can see just how expansive the trails are. The terrain, too, is vast and varied. Imagine: you take the Comet Express ski lift up to the peak of the mountain, where the snow is powdery and light. Halfway through, the snow is a little more compact, scraped in some areas. Near the bottom of the lift, you can see patches of ice that grind underneath your skis, before finally arriving at the softer, more slushy snow right at the base of the lift. It’s an all-in-one experience, with something for every type of skier, no matter their experience. </p>

        <p>My family owns a small studio-like condo at the base of the Queens chair. Every morning, I have the pleasure of looking outside on that snowy expanse, watching the sun peak through the snow-covered pine trees and glide across the newly groomed snow as I eat my soggy cereal. There’s that moment of absolute bliss and quietude on the mountain—before 8am rolls around and people start strapping on their poles, snowboard, skis, boots, and helmets to be the first on the slope. </p>

        <p>Smack dab in the middle of the mountain is the village centre, nestled at the base of the old Yellow Chair and backing off onto the Silverwoods lift. There, you’ll find the retail shop <a href="https://www.skisilverstar.com/business/evolve/" target="_blank">Evolve</a>, the <a href="https://www.skisilverstar.com/rentals/" target="_blank">rental shop</a>, the <a href="https://www.skisilverstar.com/business/the-lord-aberdeen-market/" target="_blank">Lord Aberdeen Market</a> stocked with essential groceries, the <a href="https://https://www.skisilverstar.com/business/the-village-ski-shop/" target="_blank">Ski Shop</a>, and the <a href="https://https://www.skisilverstar.com/business/daycare/" target="_blank">daycare centre</a>. In terms of food, why not enjoy some good old Canadian cuisine at the <a href="https://https://www.skisilverstar.com/business/red-antler/" target="_blank">Red Antler</a>, enjoy a beverage and pastry at <a href="https://www.skisilverstar.com/business/coffee-plus/" target="_blank">Coffee+</a>, or perhaps end a long day at the <a href="https://www.skisilverstar.com/business/den-bar-bistro/" target="_blank">Den Bar & Bistro</a>. And you can’t forget their iconic bar—<a href="https://www.skisilverstar.com/business/the-bulldog-grand-cafe/" target="_blank">the Bulldog</a>. Rowdy and packed with people who all have a level of passion for winter sports, you can’t not enjoy an evening at the Bulldog. </p>

        <p>Best of all, there’s a trail for everyone. A beginner? The mountain has a plethora of green runs that are groomed everyday so there’s never any snow building to cause any unexpected moguls. And what about for more advanced skiers? Well, there’s so many blue runs to choose from that cover the entirety of the mountain. Best of all, most are incredibly wide, which is perfect for those who want to practice turning or balance. Feeling a little riskier? The black diamond and double black diamond runs are just for you—just head off the Comet to the Backside, where you’ll be greeted with terrain literally designed for expert-level skiers. Plus, there’s even a small restaurant—<a href="https://www.skisilverstar.com/business/paradise-camp/" target="_blank">Paradise Camp</a>—that one can check out without having to return to the village to grab something to eat. How convenient is that?</p>
        <p>There’s a reason why Silver Star is my number one place to go when I want to ski. Aside from the fact there is sentimental value, that mountain has everything a skier such as myself can ask for. And I am most certainly paying a visit again this Christmas season. </p>
        <p>To those who also want to escape to a snowy paradise, go get those <a href="https://www.skisilverstar.com/tickets/winter/" target="_blank">ski passes</a> and buckle up; the mountain’s waiting for you!  </p>
