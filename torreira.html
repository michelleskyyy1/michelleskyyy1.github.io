        <h1 class="About-me">The Quiet Authenticity of Torreira, Portugal</h1>
        <h4>April 8 2022
        09:36</h4>
        <p>It was dusk by the time our plane landed in Lisbon, Portugal. Stepping outside the airport, my family and I are immediately greeted by narrow and winding streets fenced in by white buildings with jarringly red roofs, all packed together like sardines. Peaking up from the tiled roofs was the occasional church tower or speck of green from the few trees that managed to live in such a densely urban area. </p>
        
        <div class="container">
                <div class="row">
    <div class="col-12">
         <img class="center-block" id="dude1" src="images/lisbon1.jpg">
    </div>
</div>
        </div>
        <p>But we didn’t stay in Lisbon long—no, our goal was a place that was another two hour and thirty-nine-minute drive away: Torreira.</p> 
<p>This small town is the exact opposite of what one might consider a ‘touristy’ location; the homes were old, their white finishes greyed out and peeling. The paint on some of the windows was peeling, and some buildings were completely uninhabitable, with barred up windows and doors. 
</p>
        <p>But Torreria isn’t meant to be a touristy destination. It has its own community that was separate from the tourism and sparkly beaches and fancy restaurants. It was genuine. </p>
        
        <p>Plus, Torreira holds a special significance in our family; it was where my mother’s parents used to live before immigrating to Canada. In fact, me, my sister, and parents all stayed at the very same house my grandparents used to live. The place was a rather simple living space: a small living room to the right, a kitchen to the left, and along one small hallway stretch were two small bedrooms, each possessing a queen-sized bed, a drawer, and two nightstands. </p>
        <p>Homey. That was the most accurate word to describe that place. </p>
        <p>The next day, we set off to the town square. It was there I acquainted myself with the closeness of the community. Past the town square was a long strip of white stone that overlooked a vast beach area, where many aged gentlemen sat together, talking and laughing in Portuguese. Off to my left was a small volleyball setup, where many teenagers cheered each other on. It looked as if half the population of Torreira was there to watch the current match. </p>

                <div class="row">
    <div class="col-12">
         <img class="center-block" id="dude1" src="images/torreira2.jpg">
    </div>
</div>
        </div>
        
        <p>Throughout my stay, I frequented many local restaurants, such as the Restaurante A Varina (which served excellent Salsa Verde), the restaurant Avenida Praia (their fish was simply exquisite), and the Xavega Mar (visited because it was a favourite among the locals, stayed for the prawns). But the place that stood out to me the most was this tiny little building sitting right on the edge of the beach: the Gelataria A.t Milano Barra, aka. the best ice cream shop I’ve ever had the pleasure of visiting. </p>
        
         <div class="container">
                <div class="row">
    <div class="col-12">

    </div>
</div>
        </div>
        
        <p>We happened upon it by chance, really. My family and I had spent some time at the beach and were looking for somewhere to eat before heading back to our residence. My sister spotted the ice cream first: a young waitress, probably in her early 20s, stepped outside with a round metal platter carrying two large glasses filled to the brim with ice cream. Naturally, our immediate priority shifted to trying that ice cream. Upon seating ourselves, the same young waitress approached us, holding out small, laminated menus. </p>
        
        <p>“Let me know when you would like to order something,” she said. </p>
        <p>I was startled by this. Up until this point, everyone I had met spoke strictly Portuguese. Yet this young lady was fluent in English. </p>
        <p>According to her, she had first learned English in school, and, while furthering her studies, decided to continue learning the language so she may go abroad someday. I couldn’t help but admire her dedication in learning a foreign language, which sparked a sort of connectedness with her. I, too, am bilingual, fluent in both English and French, and decided to continue studying French up until university since I genuinely enjoyed the process of learning a language. </p>
        <p>Eventually, though, she left to retrieve our ice cream. I played it safe, opting for a simple vanilla flavour. That’s how you can tell when an ice cream shop was good, after all. If their vanilla ice cream leaves much to be desired, then there’s not much point in trying the other flavours. </p>
          <div class="container">

    <div class="col-12">
         <img class="center-block" id="dude1" src="images/food1.jpg">
    </div>
</div>
        </div>
        
        <p>My sister, of course, had other intentions, ordering herself three individual scoops of gelato: Stracciatella, panna cotta, and pistachio. </p>
        <p>The waitress returned shortly, ice cream in one hand and small milkshake spoons in the other. And I kid you not when I say this: that gelato was the best I have ever had. Smooth, rich, creamy, and just the right amount of sweetness. What’s more, their flavours were all made in-store in small batches. There was a sort of authentic feeling to it; that this ice cream was not made in a factory like most big brand name, but made in the back of a small shop, fresh and readily available for visitors once the doors open. </p>
        <p>My family didn’t stay long after that, as we had much more of Portugal to explore. But even after four years since my last visit, Torreira’s unapologetic authenticity remains the most striking memory of that travel. </p>
